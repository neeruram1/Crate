//Annotation:
//This file is defining Graph QL queries for finding all products and finding a single product by id. It's importing the getAll and getById functions from the resolver.js file and invoking those functions in the appropriate query. For example - in the productById query - the resolve: getById is handling the query for the fields contained in the query, and it is generating the appropriate response.
